I'm running OpenClaw (AI assistant gateway) on Mac mini M4, macOS 26.3.
The web UI (port 18789) is not responding.
- I'm not a developer, need step-by-step terminal commands
- Config: ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
- Logs: /tmp/openclaw/openclaw-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log
- Workspace: ~/Mac-Mini-Obsidian-Vault/1. openclaw/

## 🔧 Most Common Fixes

### Gateway Won't Start
```bash
openclaw status
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Web UI Down But Gateway Running
```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :18789

# Restart gateway
openclaw gateway restart

# Access web UI
open http://127.0.0.1:18789/
```

### Newsletter Automation Not Running
```bash
# Check LaunchAgent is loaded
launchctl list | grep com.openclaw.newsletter

# If not loaded, reload it
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.openclaw.newsletter.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.openclaw.newsletter.plist

# Check logs
tail -f /tmp/openclaw/newsletter.log
```

### Can't Reach Via iMessage
Check that:
- Messages.app is signed in
- `imsg` CLI is installed: `which imsg`
- OpenClaw gateway is running: `openclaw status`
